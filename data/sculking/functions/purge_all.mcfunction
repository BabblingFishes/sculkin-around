## NOTE: What this will not purge:
# Forceloads at 0,0 of each dimension (Other datapacks frequently use these and I have no way to keep track)
# Warp Spore items (I can't go hunting down every chest in your save)
# Scoreboard objectives (Easy to remove manually + would break things if you kept using the datapack without reloading)
